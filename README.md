# LLM-Mapping
This is the repository for my capstone project titled "Mapping the Role of GPT in the Global Diffusion and Visibility of Computer Science Research"

The code contains python notebook files for data processing and visualization.

Furthermore, it also contains stata code for the data analysis process.

The data is not made public, contact farhan.kamrul@nyu.edu for the datasets.


Note: The codefiles need some rerouting to the correct dataset paths.
